## Layouts

The template is based on small, content-agnostic partials that can be mixed and matched. The pre-built pages showcase just a few of the possible combinations. Refer to the `site/layouts/partials` folder for all available partials.

Use Hugo’s `dict` functionality to feed content into partials and avoid repeating yourself and creating discrepancies.

## CSS

The template uses a custom fork of Tachyons and PostCSS with cssnext and cssnano. To customize the template for your brand, refer to `src/css/imports/_variables.css` where most of the important global variables like colors and spacing are stored.

## SVG

All SVG icons stored in `site/static/img/icons` are automatically optimized with SVGO (gulp-svgmin) and concatenated into a single SVG sprite stored as a a partial called `svg.html`. Make sure you use consistent icons in terms of viewport and art direction for optimal results. Refer to an SVG via the `<use>` tag like so:

```
<svg width="16px" height="16px" class="db">
  <use xlink:href="#SVG-ID"></use>
</svg>
```
