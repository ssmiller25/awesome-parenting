This will setup everything needed for running the CMS:

* Full Continuous Deployment to Netlify's global CDN network
* Control users and access with Netlify Identity

Once the initial build finishes, you can invite yourself as a user. Go to the Identity tab in your new site, click "Invite" and send yourself an invite.

Now you're all set, and you can start editing content!
